## OCAA Scraper by Julián Restrepo
***

In this project, I will create a scraper bot that will gather data from the Ontario College Athletic Association (OCAA).
This data will be transfered to more intuitive systems for general public to use. For example a trainer from ateam could
use the final data to create the strategy for his team.

### Data to gather:
Results of matches from the Men's Basketball league in Ontario Colleges.
Individual information on the performance of each player in each match.
The data is going to be sent to Pandas and MS Excel. This allows people with no programming knowledge to use the data.

### Summary of Process:
1. A scraper is going to get the data from the OCAA Website
2. Clean the data. Since the data comes from a good source it is already very clean, the rest of the cleaning process can be done automatically.
3. Assign the data to Pandas Dataframes.
4. A bot is going to send the Dataframes to a MS Excel Template previously created.
5. The final result of the MS Excel database is called "OCAA Database".
